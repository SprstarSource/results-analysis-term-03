' modExamenAnalysis03  -  unified module (experimental BAC)
'   1) reads every .xlsx in the folder  ExamenSource03  (next to this workbook)
'   2) consolidates marks per class  (Philo, LEtr, SE01, SE02, Math, GEc)
'   3) builds a NEW workbook:  Gen + 6 class sheets + data-transfer summary
'      - semester average computed here (coefficients per class)
'      - class tables sorted by average (descending), analysis tables below
'      - analysis cells are fixed values (no formulas); Gen section 3 only has
'        row-wise conditional colouring (lowest red / highest green)
'   4) saves it next to this workbook:  <Arabic name> .xlsx / _01 / _02 ...
'   Subject recognition: exact keywords first; if none matches, a one-wrong-letter
'   fallback (unique subject only) - every such guess is written in the transfer sheet.
' All Arabic text is stored as hex code points (ArHex) so this file is pure ASCII.
